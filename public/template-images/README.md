# Template Preview Resources

This directory contains resources to help showcase the template:

- `template-preview.html`: An HTML representation of the template layout that can be opened in a browser to generate a preview image
- Other placeholder images that can be used for documentation

## How to Generate a Preview Image

1. Open the `template-preview.html` file in a web browser
2. Take a screenshot of the page (use browser developer tools to adjust the viewport if needed)
3. Save the screenshot as `template-preview.png` in the `/public` directory
4. This image can be used in your GitHub repository and README to showcase your template

## Using Sample Images

The template includes sample image placeholders that can be replaced with actual screenshots or images when implementing the template for your own use.
