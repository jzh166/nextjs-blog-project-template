Cell sorting is essential for many biological applications. Our new approach uses stimulated Raman spectroscopy for label-free cell sorting.

This technique allows for high-throughput analysis and sorting of cells based on their intrinsic chemical properties without the need for labels or markers.

The system can detect metabolic differences in cellular composition, enabling new applications in cancer research, stem cell biology, and pharmaceutical development.
