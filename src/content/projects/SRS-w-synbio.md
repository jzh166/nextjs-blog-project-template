Monitoring biosynthesis activity at single-cell level is key to metabolic
engineering but is still difficult to achieve in a label-free manner. Using
hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging in the 670–900 cm−1
region, localized limonene synthesis are visualized inside engineered
Escherichia coli. The colocalization of limonene and GFP-fused limonene
synthase is confirmed by co-registered stimulated Raman scattering and
two-photon fluorescence images. The finding suggests a limonene synthesis
metabolon with a polar distribution inside the cells. This finding expands the knowledge of de novo limonene biosynthesis in engineered bacteria and
highlights the potential of SRS chemical imaging in metabolic engineering
research.
