# Sample Markdown Post

This is a sample blog post written in Markdown format. It demonstrates how to structure your content using Markdown syntax.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is much easier to write than JSON for several reasons:

- **Simple Syntax**: Markdown uses intuitive symbols for formatting
- **Readability**: It's easy to read even in its raw form
- **Compatibility**: Works well with version control systems
- **Widespread Adoption**: Used by many blogging and documentation platforms

## Code Examples

You can include code snippets with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

## Images

You can include images easily:

![Sample Image](/blog-images/sample-image.jpg)

## Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, or ***both***. You can also create:

1. Ordered lists
2. With multiple items

Or:

- Unordered lists
- Like this one

## Conclusion

Markdown provides a much more natural writing experience while still maintaining structure that can be programmatically processed.
