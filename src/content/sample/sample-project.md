# Sample Project in Markdown

This is a sample project written in Markdown format. It demonstrates how to structure your project documentation using Markdown syntax.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Markdown-based content system for a Next.js website. It provides a more natural writing experience while maintaining structured data.

## Key Features

- **Frontmatter Metadata**: YAML metadata at the top of markdown files
- **Rich Markdown Content**: Support for headings, lists, code blocks, and more
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support for both JSON and Markdown formats
- **Optimized Performance**: Fast rendering of markdown content

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses the following libraries:

- `gray-matter` for parsing frontmatter
- `remark` and `remark-html` for converting markdown to HTML

```javascript
// Example code for parsing markdown
import matter from 'gray-matter';

function parseMarkdown(content) {
  const { data, content } = matter(content);
  return {
    metadata: data,
    content
  };
}
```

## Conclusion

Using markdown for content management provides a much better authoring experience while maintaining the structured data needed for the website.
