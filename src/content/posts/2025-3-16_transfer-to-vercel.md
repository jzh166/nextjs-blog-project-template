# Transfer from siteground to vercel 
*when i setup the website for the first, I used siteground to host the website. But it told me the renewal will be $250 a year. 
This is insance! So I did a bit research and decided to transfered to vercel.*

The first step is backup the old website, for which I used FileZilla. Because other *seemingly-convenient* options are all not free! The process is quite smooth. 

Then I found a template on vercel and then clone to my local machine. I then did some editing. Thanks to Claude, I get everything done in several hours without any prior knowledge in js!
