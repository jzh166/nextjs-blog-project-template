Flume Gorge is in New Hampshire and close to Mt. Lafayette.

It is a bit similar to a natural attraction close to my hometown, which is called "大峡谷", literally "The big gorge"

The trial is about 1.5 hours companies by rivers, falls, pools, and many plants!

We saw many trees born on a rock! I never saw so many in other places:

We also saw a Tamias (花栗鼠). It picked some leaves, probably for his/her nest!

There is also a rock cave called wolf den. It is small, wet, and all black (not too long). We squeezed through, and it was fun :0
