I recently read the story of Mr. Fuqing Zhang, an elder man from Shanxi Province. 

He passed away at his 70s this year. Before he passed away, he left many handwritten "blog" on the walls of his yard, which is in a small village. These handwritings are net and with a poetic spirit, and cast huge contrast to the yard and the village. People then got interested in his life story and came from all around the country to visit his yard.

He wrote "飞机飞到太阳20年才能到" （it takes an airplane 20 years to fly to the sun） and "每年杏花落打药一次，立秋后再打一次虫药" （Spray pesticide once every year when the apricot blossoms fall, and spray insecticide again after the beginning of autumn）

His life is untypical but not smooth. He spoke to himself. I am not sure whether he would like other people to see his journals. 

It is like me building a website here. I saw him to some extent.
